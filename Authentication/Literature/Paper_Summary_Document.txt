- paper_on_preprocessing_eeg.pdf
This paper discusses a standardized pipeline for preprocessing of EEG signals. It discusses why standardized data is important and types of noise which occur in the measurements:
1. Line Noise: This is noise caused by the interference of Power Lines on the gamma band in the 50-60 Hz range;
2. Bad/outlier channels: Sometimes, a recorded is simply useless for whatever reason, but this can be detected and disregarded;
Conclusion:
Approach is able to preprocess data and detect problems with dataset that can cause downstream issues. There is also something about
classification but this is discussed briefly.

- paper_comparision_wavelet_fft.pdf
This paper discusses an alternative to the Fast Fourier Transform, the Wavelet Transform, which is a tradeoff between showing the frequency components somewhat accurately, while keeping information about when these frequencies occur in the time domain.
Conclusion: 
The wavelet transform works better for detecting abnormal brain activity (seizures)


Dry-Contact_Electrode_Ear-EEG
This paper compares ear-EEG with normal EEG for four standard EEG paradigms. The electrodes set-up was done in four ways: scalp-scalp (normal EEG), ear-scalp, between ears, within ear.
It has four parts:
1. Describes the dry-contact ear-EEG platform
2. Describes experimental set up
3. Describes experimental paradigms and signal processing methods
4. Describes evaluation methods for skin impedance
Important conclusions:
Both auditory and visual steady-state responses are visible and statistically relevant using within-ear EEG.
For the mismatch paradigm, the within-ear electrodes did not deliver statistically significant results. The between ears set-up did provide a image of the first 2 negative and first positive potential differences that where also seen in the normal EEG.
For the alpha band paradigm, both the ear-scalp and the within-ear configurations. The ear-scalp had a clearer result.
General conclusion:
"We believe that the prototyped dry-contact ear-EEG platform represents an important technological advancement in user-friendliness, because it eliminates the need for gel in the electrode-skin interface"

Paper on classifying EEG single channel SSVEP-based BCI through SVM:
This paper compares using optimized support vector machine(SVM) ML model to other state of the art models for classication.
The Introduction explains EEG on a basic level, which makes it very understandable
The sections after that detail the other state-of-the-art approaches, the system & experiment setup, and results & conclusions.
Important conclusions:
The SVM approach provides way better performance for the smaller time windows(2, 3, 4 seconds), compared to the other approaches.
pretraining the ML model on evolutionary algorithm is a well performing choice
