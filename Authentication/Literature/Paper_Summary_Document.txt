- paper_on_preprocessing_eeg.pdf
This paper discusses a standardized pipeline for preprocessing of EEG signals. It discusses why standardized data is important and types of noise which occur in the measurements:
1. Line Noise: This is noise caused by the interference of Power Lines on the gamma band in the 50-60 Hz range;
2. Bad/outlier channels: Sometimes, a recorded is simply useless for whatever reason, but this can be detected and disregarded;
Conclusion:
Approach is able to preprocess data and detect problems with dataset that can cause downstream issues. There is also something about
classification but this is discussed briefly.

- paper_comparision_wavelet_fft.pdf
This paper discusses an alternative to the Fast Fourier Transform, the Wavelet Transform, which is a tradeoff between showing the frequency components somewhat accurately, while keeping information about when these frequencies occur in the time domain.
Conclusion: 
The wavelet transform works better for detecting abnormal brain activity (seizures)


Dry-Contact_Electrode_Ear-EEG
This paper compares ear-EEG with normal EEG for four standard EEG paradigms. The electrodes set-up was done in four ways: scalp-scalp (normal EEG), ear-scalp, between ears, within ear.
It has four parts:
1. Describes the dry-contact ear-EEG platform
2. Describes experimental set up
3. Describes experimental paradigms and signal processing methods
4. Describes evaluation methods for skin impedance
Important conclusions:
Both auditory and visual steady-state responses are visible and statistically relevant using within-ear EEG.
For the mismatch paradigm, the within-ear electrodes did not deliver statistically significant results. The between ears set-up did provide a image of the first 2 negative and first positive potential differences that where also seen in the normal EEG.
For the alpha band paradigm, both the ear-scalp and the within-ear configurations. The ear-scalp had a clearer result.
General conclusion:
"We believe that the prototyped dry-contact ear-EEG platform represents an important technological advancement in user-friendliness, because it eliminates the need for gel in the electrode-skin interface"

Paper on classifying EEG single channel SSVEP-based BCI through SVM:
This paper compares using optimized support vector machine(SVM) ML model to other state of the art models for classication.
The Introduction explains EEG on a basic level, which makes it very understandable
The sections after that detail the other state-of-the-art approaches, the system & experiment setup, and results & conclusions.
Important conclusions:
The SVM approach provides way better performance for the smaller time windows(2, 3, 4 seconds), compared to the other approaches.
pretraining the ML model on evolutionary algorithm is a well performing choice


A Study of Evoked Potentials From Ear-EEG
This paper is very similair to the "Dry-Contact_Electrode_Ear-EEG" paper and also drawes the same conclusion that for most applications the ear-electrodes are useful.

Words and pseudowords elicit distinct patterns of 30-Hz EEG responses in humans
The title is basically the summary. this might be useful for authentication by letting the subject remember a series of nonsense and normal words in a order that only he knows. It can be quite easily picked up from temporal information what the order of the words is, which can act as a password.

Individual Classification of Emotions Using EEG
Classification between 4 different emotions that are elicited using video's is obtained with an accuracy of 97%. This is done by using signal processing and machine learning on signals from an EEG.

Rapid Memory Reactivation Revealed by Osicllatory Entrainment
The article is about an experiment in which researchers tagged certain memories of subjects. This was done by making the subjects look at words with a flickering background that has a certain frequency. When the words are later shown to them without the flickering, the same activation that was caused by the frequency is still visible in an EEG.
This could be really useful by calibrating the device by tagging a word or other memory and showing this word again when trying to log in somewhere. I have not yet found many papers supporting this paper.

Assessing the utility of frequency tagging for tracking memory-based reactivation of word representations
Quite like the "Rapid Memory Reactivation Revealed by Osicllatory Entrainment" paper, so extra evidence that frequency tagging might be a viable option.

Probing cortical excitability using rapid frequency tagging
This paper provides prove that frequency tagging is also possible at higher frequencies. 

Brain EEG signal processing for controlling a robotic arm
T is 10 voor 5 dus ga hier morgen uitgebreider naar kijken, maar dit was even een hersenspinseltje. Voor nu lijkt het me wel cool dat als je iemand kan aanleren een derde arm te besturen op basis van een EEG je dit mss ook met een virtuele arm kan doen oid die een beweging moet maken oid als wachtwoord. Het hoeft natuurlijk ook niet om een arm te gaan per se, maar wel cool bewijs dat je het brein iets aan kan leren dus wij zouden ook een brein aan kunnen leren om met hersenen een wachtwoord in te vullen.
