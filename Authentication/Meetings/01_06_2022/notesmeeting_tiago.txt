Auth:
-Focus on writing thesis well, clearly explain the problem we ran into
-Try to still do the pseudowords thing if time permits

Phantom:
-Problems with order and delivery
-6 petri dishes at a time for degassing
-After the meeting they make them, they need to get to room temperature again
-Afterwards degassing and then in the fridge
-Aluminum tape to do the test? Training with Filip at 14:40
-Then electrical characterization of phantom is gotten, sweet spot needs to be found and used
-Sweep the parameters
-Then make the mold
-Next week changes over time
-Mention error due to glue and thickness of tape
-
Stimulus:
-forgot something so the voltage is higher, 100V instead of 70V
-Outliers in impedance are not possible to stimulate anymore due to the small error^
-Today drawing traces, check sheets, check dimensions, don't trust the footprints because you don't know who made them.
-

Signal Processing:
-3 seconds epoch, so 3 seconds to react
-empirically determined 3 seconds on the data
-How translatable is this performance to small microcontroller?
-removing channels already to decrease computation time.
