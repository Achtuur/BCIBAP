Are we supposed to expect they have read the report? Don't make huge assumptions.
Did we see the rubric? Look at the rubric! Tailor well to that
How to implement PoR in presentation? Sketch ideal goal/situation. In order to do that, we need to have this and this metric, break into different things. To make the end product: phantom, we need to make it measurable: develop a capacitor, we need specs to make it precisely measurable: such and such permittivity. 
E.g. stim: we want to stimulate, we need this and this current.
E.g. Authentication: we want to authenticate, we need to do this in 5 seconds max, because otherwise it's impractical, so no gain.
At results go back to PoR. (Ideally al green ticks next to it, if red, EXPLAIN WHY, this and this was the problem. It is about the process!

Deionized water has been stolen from phantom group. 

If you read the thesis, can you give us some focal points for the presentation. Dante will put on slack a few notes. 
Give example of artifact in presentation: show an artifact and its characteristics(lasts for ... seconds, higher amplitude, etc.), we replace with average of other channels, that is a proxy for what signal should be, proposed in this paper, and here's end result.
